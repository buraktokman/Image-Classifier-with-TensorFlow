# Image Classifier with TensorFlow
Tutorial with TensorFlow for Image Classifier
Based on [Writing Our First Classifier - Machine Learning Recipes #5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoeEHqVSNOw)

## Summary
Deep Learning is great with images
No feature engineering needed

Classifier using Neural Networks
TF Learn is a high level machine learning library on top of TensorFlow

Inception
-Google's best image classifier
-Open Source
-Trained on 1.2 million images
 Training Inception took about two weeks on a fast desktop with 8 GPUs

 Retraining (also known as Transfer Learning)
 -Saves a lot of time
 -Leverages prior work

 Diversity & Quantity
 -By diversity, i mean more images of different types of roses we have, the better off
 we'll be.
