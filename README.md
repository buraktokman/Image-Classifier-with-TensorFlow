# Image Classifier with TensorFlow for Poets
Tutorial with TensorFlow for Image Classifier<br>
Based on [Writing Our First Classifier - Machine Learning Recipes #5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoeEHqVSNOw)

## Summary
Deep Learning is great with images<br>
No feature engineering needed

Classifier using Neural Networks<br>
TF Learn is a high level machine learning library on top of TensorFlow

Inception<br>
-Google's best image classifier<br>
-Open Source<br>
-Trained on 1.2 million images<br>
 Training Inception took about two weeks on a fast desktop with 8 GPUs

 Retraining (also known as Transfer Learning)<br>
 -Saves a lot of time<br>
 -Leverages prior work

 Diversity & Quantity<br>
 -By diversity, i mean more images of different types of roses we have, the better off we'll be.
